# Jamming page
This project is focused on developing a React application by applying learnings from a Web Development course. The project utilizes the React library to build a Spotify-integrated application that authenticates users via OAuth, facilitating access to their Spotify account. Users are able to search for songs, select their favorites, and create a custom playlist.

## Features
- **OAuth Authentication**: Securely authenticates users with Spotify, granting the application access to account data for playlist creation.
- **Music Search**: Allows users to search the Spotify library for tracks, viewing real-time results.
- **Playlist Creation**: Users can create a new playlist by selecting songs from their search results and save them directly to their account.
- **Responsive Design**: Implements a mobile-first design approach, ensuring the application is responsive on multiple devices.
